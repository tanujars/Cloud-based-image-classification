# Cloud-based-image-classification

In this project, I built an elastic application that can automatically scale out and in on-demand and cost-effectively by using the IaaS cloud. Specifically, this application was built using the IaaS resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the most widely used IaaS provider and offers a variety of compute, storage, and massage services. The application will offer a meaningful cloud service to users, and the technologies and techniques that we learn will be useful for us to build many others in the future.
